## Hi, I’m Francesco Ercolani

I’m an MSc graduate in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Bologna.  
My main interests have always been understanding the fundamentals of hardware and software, with a particular focus on cybersecurity. 

Recently, my professional focus has shifted towards full-stack web development.

I am passionate about continuously learning new technologies to satisfy my curiosity. 
Over time, I have also cultivated my interests and passions outside of tech: I love sports, especially running and strength training, enjoy cinema and photography, and occasionally play chess — even if I’m not very good at it.
